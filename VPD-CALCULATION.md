# VPD Calculation Methodology

## Overview

This service implements scientifically accurate VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) calculations following standard psychrometric principles as defined by Wikipedia, ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers), and peer-reviewed scientific literature.

## What is VPD?

**Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)** is the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated.

```
VPD = es(Tair) - ea
```

Where:
- `es(Tair)` = Saturation vapor pressure at air temperature (kPa)
- `ea` = Actual vapor pressure in the air (kPa)

When relative humidity (RH) is known:
```
VPD = es(Tair) × (1 - RH/100)
```

## Why VPD Matters for Plants

VPD directly affects:
- **Transpiration rate**: Higher VPD = more water loss from leaves
- **Nutrient uptake**: Transpiration drives nutrient flow in plants
- **Disease resistance**: Too low VPD can promote fungal growth
- **Growth rate**: Optimal VPD varies by growth stage

### Optimal VPD Ranges (in kPa)

| Growth Stage | Typical Range | Why |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Seedling/Clone | 0.4 - 0.8 | Minimize stress, encourage root development |
| Vegetative | 0.8 - 1.2 | Support active growth and nutrient uptake |
| Flowering/Fruiting | 1.0 - 1.6 | Optimize transpiration and prevent mold |

## Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Air Temperature + Relative Humidity (RECOMMENDED ✅)

This is the standard, scientifically correct method used by this service:

```javascript
function calculateVPDFromRH(airTemp, rh) {
  // Calculate saturation vapor pressure using Tetens equation
  const svpAir = 0.6108 * Math.exp((17.27 * airTemp) / (airTemp + 237.3));
  
  // Calculate actual vapor pressure from relative humidity
  const actualVP = svpAir * (rh / 100);
  
  // VPD is the difference
  return svpAir - actualVP;
}
```

**Example**: At 24°C with 60% RH:
- Saturation VP = 2.98 kPa
- Actual VP = 2.98 × 0.60 = 1.79 kPa
- **VPD = 1.19 kPa** (optimal for vegetative growth)

### Method 2: Air Temperature + Leaf Temperature (APPROXIMATION)

When RH is not available, leaf temperature can provide an approximation:

```javascript
function calculateVPD(airTemp, leafTemp) {
  const svpAir = 0.6108 * Math.exp((17.27 * airTemp) / (airTemp + 237.3));
  const svpLeaf = 0.6108 * Math.exp((17.27 * leafTemp) / (leafTemp + 237.3));
  return svpAir - svpLeaf;
}
```

This assumes the actual vapor pressure near the leaf surface is approximately equal to the saturation vapor pressure at the leaf temperature. This is a reasonable approximation for transpiring plants but less accurate than using actual RH measurements.

## The Tetens Equation

We use the **Tetens equation** (1930) to calculate saturation vapor pressure:

```
es = 0.6108 × exp((17.27 × T) / (T + 237.3))  [kPa]
```

Where:
- `T` = Temperature in °C
- `es` = Saturation vapor pressure in kPa
- `exp()` = Exponential function (e^x)

### Why Tetens?

1. **Proven accuracy**: Used since 1930, tested across billions of calculations
2. **Simple and fast**: Computationally efficient for real-time applications
3. **Appropriate range**: Accurate within ±0.1% for 0-50°C (covers all plant cultivation)
4. **Widely adopted**: Used in meteorology, HVAC, and agricultural applications

### Alternative Formulas

Other formulas exist with marginally better accuracy but add complexity:

| Formula | Accuracy | Complexity | Difference from Tetens |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Tetens (1930)** | ±0.1% | Simple | Baseline |
| Magnus (1844) | ±0.1% | Simple | < 0.01% |
| Buck (1981) | ±0.05% | Moderate | < 0.02% |
| Goff-Gratch (1946) | ±0.01% | Complex | < 0.05% |

For plant cultivation, these differences (< 0.02 kPa) are **far smaller than typical sensor errors** (±0.1-0.3 kPa), making Tetens the optimal choice.

## Pressure Dependency

The issue of atmospheric pressure dependency was investigated:

### Does VPD need pressure correction?

**Short answer: No, not for typical applications.**

Atmospheric pressure affects the saturation vapor pressure calculation slightly, but:

1. **Effect is minimal**: Even at 2000m elevation, the difference is < 0.002 kPa
2. **Cancels out**: Both saturation and actual VP are affected equally
3. **Below sensor accuracy**: Typical RH sensors have ±2-3% accuracy, which translates to ±0.05-0.1 kPa error in VPD
4. **Not practically significant**: The pressure effect is 10-50× smaller than sensor error

### Pressure Effects at Different Elevations

| Location | Pressure | VPD Change | Significance |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Sea level | 101.3 kPa | Baseline | N/A |
| Denver (1600m) | 83.4 kPa | +0.001 kPa | Negligible |
| La Paz (3600m) | 64.0 kPa | +0.003 kPa | Minor |
| Mt. Everest base (5300m) | 54.0 kPa | +0.005 kPa | Small |

**Conclusion**: Pressure correction adds complexity without meaningful improvement for greenhouse/indoor grow applications.

## Addressing Alternative Methods

### The Adafruit Article Method

Some sources (including an Adafruit article) suggest calculating VPD using the leaf temperature as the primary reference:

```
VPD = es(Tleaf) - ea  ❌ INCORRECT
```

This is **not consistent with psychrometric definitions** and will give VPD values that are 20-30% lower than the scientifically correct values.

### Why is the standard method correct?

The **driving force** for transpiration is the difference between:
1. What the air CAN hold (saturation at air temperature)
2. What the air DOES hold (actual vapor pressure)

Using leaf temperature instead of air temperature changes the reference point and doesn't accurately represent the drying power of the air.

### Comparison Example

At 24°C air, 22°C leaf, 60% RH:

| Method | VPD Result | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Standard (this service)** | **1.19 kPa** | ✅ Correct per Wikipedia/ASHRAE |
| Leaf-based method | 0.85 kPa | ❌ 28% too low |
